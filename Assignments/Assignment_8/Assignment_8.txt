1.  Are any of your predicted response values from your best model scientifically meaningless? Explain.
Like all of them,none of them hit the mark. Well some do but most are off and the line is completely off as well.
2.  In your plots, did you find any non-linear relationships?  If so, do a bit of research online and give a link to at least one resource explaining how to deal with this in R
