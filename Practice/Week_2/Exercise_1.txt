-You start in your Data_course Directory
-You change your directory to ./Data which might as well be just Data as . is just current directory
-You then cat your mushroom_growth.cvc file ie make all the text be barfed up which is then piped into a cut command for fields 1,3 i believe with a delim of "," not entirly sure what delim means but I assume it is to get the , out of your fields. Also this command line isn't working on mine so can't be sure what it does. This is then piped into a sort command that is piped into a uniq command for mushrooms.txt which also isn't workign for me.
-followed by the sed command which is a steaming editor. Whatever that is.

-you are asking grep to give you a count of the lines with "ostreotus" in mushrooms.txt

-This a loop command for value fn in 0 to infinite .txt files echo " "------" into another echo for fn head first two line into another echo of  "------". So essentially you created a loop to go into all .txt files in data-shell/data to head the first two lines and having  "------" be echoed before and after to separate them out in a readable fashion
